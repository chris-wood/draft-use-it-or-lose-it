After all, the benefit is not necessarily something that the implementer sees, it's one that the community as a whole sees (or might see) in the fullness of time.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you couch a question about deploying encryption in the same way, you might have similar trouble in justification.  The answer is usually tied into hedging strategies against the risk of future problems.  \r\n\r\nFor example, you might reasonably say that making cleartext DNS queries in most networks is benign.  And the cost of deploying encryption is considerable. More so if you start with the understanding that most network operators accord those requests with due respect, including taking every effort to ensure that they are the only ones that see those packets.  If you consider the breadth of possible networks and the span of time, the occasional instances of failures in that regard might lead to a different risk assessment.\r\n\r\nCollectively, the QUIC working group has expended significant energy on this general question.  This is in part because of a deeper understanding of the risk profile in that environment.  This stuff really does happen.  I don't know if I recounted the story about Google's QUIC breaking a few years ago due to bad assumptions made about the semantics of a key protocol element.  Add the scars from multiple bad experiences with TLS and you might appreciate that there is some desire to address the problem proactively.\r\n\r\nOf course, even with the desire to protect future extensibility, there is some justified skepticism about the efficacy of greasing as a general mechanism.

The adversary is not an active attacker, but a benign, possibly buggy middlebox. Greasing to exercise size limits on TLS flights seems like a way to test this in practice.\r\n2. ECH: in practice, we're primarily concerned with whether passive or active middleboxes will tamper with or otherwise block connections using this extension. Greasing _might_ also apply here, but it's less clear than the above example.\r\n\r\nIn general, the threat model here seems to be more in line with (1). The syntax (wire image) of a protocol might trigger certain middlebox or endpoint behavior that is undesired, and so greasing to avoid these seems generally good. In contrast, (2) modifies both the syntax _and_, in way, the semantics of the protocol. Greasing in the spirit of this draft doesn't seem immediately applicable. \r\n\r\nIf it would be useful, I can try and contribute some text to clarify the desired threat model. ",

          "body": "Useful: yes; easy: no.\r\n\r\nTo start with, I think that the ECH greasing is not entirely in scope here.  Part of that is related to the threat model, where we are considering adversaries of varying levels of sophistication and motivation who might want to block, disrupt, or undermine ECH deployment.  That's a little beyond the scope of this document I think.\r\n\r\nThe PQ thing is twofold: it's a performance optimization problem (handshakes that span multiple packets, exceeding congestion windows or anti-amplification limits), and a problem where implementations choke on big messages.  I suspect that the former is worse than the latter, but I have no direct information.\r\n\r\nThe main thing this draft attempts to address is the potential for neglect or laziness to stymie attempts to evolve protocols.  The goal is to capture all the natural pressures on implementations that might lead to ossifying choices.  This includes economy of implementation and various security-based things.  Aside from outright bugs, we are talking about implementations deliberately building features that constrain or prevent protocol evolution.  \r\n\r\nSo the threat model here is an actor that is either ignorant of or sufficiently insulated from the effects of ossification.  Nothing in the document - except perhaps from the encryption bit - is effective against a deliberate attempt to prevent protocol evolution.\r\n\r\nECH definitely has a threat model that is a superset of this on that basis.\r\n\r\nPQ might fit if we're just talking about bugs, but it might just be running into limits of what is fair game for standardization if we are talking about the performance aspects.  If you look at QUIC, the limits of standardization are clear: we could say \"all networks MUST support UDP\", but that won't stop networks from choosing to block UDP.  We can change the cost-benefit analysis by making QUIC support more or less attractive, but we can't take that choice away altogether.",

Reserving codepoints without attributing semantics to their use can result in diverse or conflicting semantics being attributed without any hope of interoperability. An example of this is the \"class E\" address space in IPv4 {{?RFC0988}}, which was reserved without assigning any semantics. For protocols that can use negotiation to attribute semantics to codepoints, it is possible that unused codepoints can be reclaimed for active use, though this requires that the negotiation include all protocol participants.\"\r\n\r\nThis is valid of course. The text is good as is. However, it might be useful to point out that reclaiming in class E type cases is difficult, because you'd have to negotiate with everyone on the path, as otherwise the intervening routers may discard packets that seemingly use wrong kind of addresses. Or clarify that the latter part of the paragraph applies only to actually *unused* codepoints, whereas *reserved-but-unused* has likely lead to code that prohibits the use.\r\n\r\nE.g., one could add this text to the end of the paragraph: \"This is in practice impossible in situations such as those involving class E addresses, as all protocol participants would have to include every node along the path.\"\r\n",

These interoperability problems can hinder or stop deployment of new, valuable features even if the negative reactions happen infrequently or only under relatively rare conditions. Fixing bugs\r\nthat limit interoperability involves a difficult process that includes identifying the cause of these errors, finding the responsible implementation(s), coordinating a bug fix and release plan, contacting users and/or the operator of affected services, and waiting for the fix to be deployed. Especially for protocols involving multiple parties or that are considered critical infrastructure (e.g., IP, BGP, DNS, or TLS), it could even be necessary to come up with a new protocol design that uses a different method to achieve the same result.\"\r\n\r\n2) I would move the examples in 2.2. to the appendix and maybe only keep this paragraph (of the TLS section):\r\n\r\n\"Even where extension points have multiple valid values, if the set of permitted values does not change over time, there is still a risk that new values are not tolerated by existing implementations. If the set of values for a particular field remains fixed over a long period, some implementations might not correctly handle a new value when it is introduced. For example, implementations of TLS broke when new values of the signature_algorithms extension were introduced.\"\r\n\r\n3) In section 2.3 the part about MPTCP and TCP Open could also go to the appendix (and maybe provide a bit more insights there).\r\n\r\n4) maybe 3.1 could also go to the appendix; also because the last two paragraphs in 3.1. are really redundant with the intro of section 3.\r\n\r\n5) I know we just shuffled this around but I guess section 3.2 and 3.3 could also be subsections of 4.
